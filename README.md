# Master's Thesis - Analysis and Evaluation of Self-Sovereign Identity Systems

Welcome to the repository of my Master's Thesis. In this thesis I focused on the components of Self-Sovereign Identity and summarized them in a SSI architecuture. I also took a closer look at BTCR, Blockstack, ETHR, ERC725, SelfKey, Veres One, and Sovrin. 

Have fun reading and let me know what you think!
